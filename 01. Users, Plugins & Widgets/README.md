## Assignments

1.
    Add two new widgets to your site, one in the sidebar and one in the footer. You can choose what widget you'd like, but an example would be a calendar widget in the sidebar and a search widget in the footer.

2.
    Create 3 new additional users to your site, one as an editor and the other two as subscribers.

    Sign in as the editor and create 5 blog posts for your site with some basic content.

    Then sign in to each subscriber account and make a couple of comments on each blog post.

    Finally sign in as the editor, or admin, and reply to the comments.

3.
    Install the [Elementor Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/)  plugin and use it to update the contents of your about page (if you don't have an about page, create one). Add a carousel with 4 images, a heading and a text editor with some Lorem Lipsum text, as well as a Google Maps block with a random location.

4.
    Time to add a contact form to your site. Install the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin and create a contact form. The form should have at least the following fields: Name, Email, Phone number and Message. Then place that form on the contact page on your site.
