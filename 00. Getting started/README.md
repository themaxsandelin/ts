This part of the lesson will help you get started setting up your localhost environment as well as setting up your very first Wordpress project.

## Assignments

1.
    Set up your very first [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download) site using any preferred local server environment (ex. [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)) and install a new theme of your own choice (we'll use [OnePress](https://wordpress.org/themes/onepress/) in the lesson).

2.
    Time to get familiar with the Wordpress admin, so make sure you play around a bit in the different admin pages. Once you are comfortable with making changes, go ahead and change the title, tagline and icon of the site.

3.
    Time to set up some pages to work with. Delete the default pages, and create 4 new pages: Home, About, Blog and Contact. Add some content to each page (except the Blog page), then configure your site to use the page Home as a static landing page, and the Blog page as the posts page.

4.
    Create your very first menu, add links to each page (Home, About, Blog and Contact) and place it in the menu location that is placed somewhere in the header.

5.
    Lastly we'll need to create some posts for our blog. Delete the default post, and create 5 new blog posts. Each blog post should have it's own title, some basic content, and it's very own category. A blog post can have multiple categories, but there should one unique category for each post.

6.
    Get familiar with the [wp-config](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php) file. Create a new database and change the `DB_NAME` in your `wp-config.php` file. Then change back to your first database to see what happens.
