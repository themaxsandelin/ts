As a final assignment you are building your own website in Wordpress with your very own custom theme. The contents of the website and the design aren't important, but you need to follow the basic requirements in order to get the grade **E**. If you want to take a chance of getting a higher grade than E, you need to do

## Requirements
The website should have the following pages:
- Landing page (front page)
- About page
- Blog page
    - Blog post page
- Contact page

The site should have a header and footer that is present on each page of the site. The header should contain a menu with links to the main pages (i.e. Home, About, Blog and Contact). The footer can contain copyright text, contact details or whatever you think fits well, but it can't be empty (ex. Name, email, phone number etc.).

The blog page should simply list out all the blog posts, and each post should link to it's very own page.

The contact page should at least contain one contact form using a plugin of your choice (for example Contact Form 7).

Lastly, you should have a `front-page.php` file for the landing page's layout, and a custom template for either the about page or the contact page (it's up to you).

## Extra

- Add at least 2 categories to your blog posts. Then create a sidebar that you place on the blog page. In the side bar, place links that allow you to filter your blog posts based on category. And lastly list the 5 most recent blog posts underneath the category links in the sidebar.

- Add a new page for your portfolio where you list out your projects. The portfolio page should have it's very own template. Then add a custom post type for your projects, where each project get's it's own page (just like blog posts do).
